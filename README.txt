Project 3

Group Members: Brayan Vizcaino & Ian Swallow

Once you run my program, it will prompt you the Input file that must be a bmp image. Then it will prompt you the s_width, then the s_height, then the t_width, then the t_height.

It will then output 2 files: 

1: output1.bmp which is breadth-first-search
2: output2.bmp which is best-first-search


I have provided 2 example input BMP images. (First example input is the test image you provided)

1: maze.bmp

s_width: 8
s_height: 8
t_width: 202
t_height: 190


2: largemaze.bmp

s_width: 1
s_height: 10
t_width: 460
t_height: 290
